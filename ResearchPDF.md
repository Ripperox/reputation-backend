What’s a Reputation System?

Imagine if your Instagram followers, victories in your favorite hobbies, and Reddit karma combined into one portable score that proves you’re trustworthy online. That’s a decentralized reputation system. Instead of Facebook or Instagram controlling your data, it lives on blockchain (a public digital ledger no one owns).

Why it matters:

No more starting from zero on every app
Stop botting of accounts 
Earn rewards for being a good user(PoS)

Current Solutions

1. Gitcoin Passport
What: Collect "stamps" (like Twitter checks or Discord memberships) to prove you’re real.

Strengths: Lets you claim Gitcoin grants fairly.

Limitations: Only works well in Gitcoin’s ecosystem.

2. Lens Protocol
What: A decentralized social media where YOU own your posts/followers.

Strengths: Your profile works across multiple apps.

Limitations: Still new and not many users yet.

3. BrightID

What: Proves you’re not a bot by checking your social connections.

Strengths: Stops people from making 100 fake accounts.

Limitations: Feels creepy to map your friends.

My Idea: TrustGraph (Like a Web3 Credit Score)
How It Works:
Soulbound Tokens (SBTs): Digital badges you earn (can’t sell/trade them).

Example: Earn a "DAO Master" SBT for great contributions to a Discord group.

Hybrid Storage:

Blockchain: Stores your score (e.g., "Rep Score: 89/100").

IPFS (decentralized cloud): Stores proof, like screenshots of your work.

Privacy: Use math magic (zk-SNARKs) to prove you’re trustworthy without revealing personal info.

What Makes It Fair:
No cheating: Can’t fake SBTs (they’re tied to your crypto wallet).

Context matters: Your "Art NFT Expert" score won’t affect your "DeFi Trader" score.

Community voting: Disputes are settled by real users, not a company.

USE CASES

1. DAO Power-Ups
Get more voting power in a DAO (like a Discord group that manages money) based on your contributions, not just how many tokens you hold.

2. Freelance Hustles
Show clients your rep from past gigs (stored on blockchain) instead of begging for LinkedIn recommendations.

3. DeFi Perks
Borrow crypto with less collateral if you have a good repayment history (like a Web3 credit score).
